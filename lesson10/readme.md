Homework 9


Volcano NFT


We now want to create an NFT.


We will use the Open Zeppelin libraries to help with this.


1. Create a new project in the IDE of you choice called NFTProject
2. Create a VolcanoNFT contract this should inherit from any ERC721 implementation
from the Open Zeppelin standard libraries
- Give your NFT a name and a symbol.
3. Write unit tests to check that you can
- Mint new NFTs
- Transfer an NFT
- Deploy your contract to Goerli and send some NFTs to your colleagues.
